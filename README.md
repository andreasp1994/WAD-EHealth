## Synopsis

Web Application Development Course - Group Project

The purpose of this application is to help people find out about particular conditions and to save the information that they find into different folders. The application lets people search across two different medical sites (medline and healthfinder) and the general web (bing).
People using the application can self-diagnose, i.e. given some symptoms find out what are the likely conditions. They can also like to find out information about particular conditions, treatments and medicines. The application helps the users understand if the information is easy to read, is loaded with senitment and subjectivity.

The APIâ€™s for the federated search are:

http://healthfinder.gov/developer/How_to_Use.aspx <br />
